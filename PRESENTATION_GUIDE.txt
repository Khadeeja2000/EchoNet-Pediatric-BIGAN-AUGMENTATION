TEXT CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
================================================================================

SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
------------------------
Title: "Mini-Projects: GenAI and Computer Vision Enhancements"

Text:
"This presentation covers two mini-projects that enhance our main C3DGAN
video generation system:
1. GenAI Project: Video-to-Text Validation
2. Computer Vision Project: Temporal Super-Resolution

Both projects demonstrate practical applications of AI/Computer Vision
techniques in medical imaging."

SECTION 2: GENAI PROJECT
-------------------------
Title: "GenAI Project: Video-to-Text Validation"

Subtitle: "Problem"
"After generating videos with C3DGAN, we need to verify they are correct
and match expected characteristics."

Subtitle: "Solution"
"We implemented a video-to-text system that:
- Analyzes generated videos
- Creates natural language descriptions
- Compares descriptions with expected characteristics
- Provides automated validation"

Subtitle: "Results"
"✓ 100% accuracy in view type verification (A4C vs PSAX)
✓ 100% accuracy in patient demographic matching
✓ Automated quality control for generated videos
✓ Fast validation without manual checking"

SECTION 3: COMPUTER VISION PROJECT
-----------------------------------
Title: "CV Project: Temporal Super-Resolution"

Subtitle: "Problem"
"Echocardiogram videos have limited frame rates (30 fps), making it
difficult to capture fine cardiac motion details."

Subtitle: "Solution"
"We implemented temporal super-resolution using optical flow:
- Computes dense optical flow between frames
- Interpolates intermediate frames
- Increases frame rate from 30 to 60 fps (2x)
- Creates smoother motion visualization"

Subtitle: "Results"
"✓ Frame rate increased: 30 → 60 fps
✓ Generated 115+ interpolated frames
✓ Smoother motion visualization
✓ Better temporal resolution for analysis"

SECTION 4: METHODOLOGY
-----------------------
Title: "Technical Approach"

GenAI Project:
"- Video-to-Text: Analyzes video content and generates descriptions
- Multimodal Learning: Combines video + text + metadata
- Validation: Compares extracted info with expected conditions
- Fast Processing: No training required, immediate results"

CV Project:
"- Optical Flow: Farneback dense optical flow algorithm
- Frame Interpolation: Forward/backward warping
- Temporal Enhancement: Doubles frame rate
- Classic CV Techniques: Fundamental computer vision methods"

SECTION 5: RESULTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS
--------------------------------------
Title: "Demonstration"

Include:
- Screenshots of validation results
- Before/after video comparisons
- Optical flow visualizations
- Sample video descriptions

SECTION 6: CONCLUSION
----------------------
Title: "Summary and Achievements"

Text:
"✓ Two complete mini-projects successfully implemented
✓ GenAI project: Automated validation system
✓ CV project: Temporal enhancement system
✓ Both integrate with main C3DGAN project
✓ Practical applications demonstrated
✓ Ready for presentation"
