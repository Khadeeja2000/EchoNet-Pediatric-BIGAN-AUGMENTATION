Subtitle: "Automated Quality Control Using Multimodal Generative AI"

Your Name, Course, Date

SLIDE 2: PROBLEM STATEMENT
---------------------------
Title: "Why Do We Need Validation?"

Problem:
"After generating echocardiogram videos using C3DGAN, we need to verify:
- Do generated videos have the correct view type (A4C vs PSAX)?
- Do they match the patient demographics used for generation?
- Are the generated videos medically plausible?
- How can we automatically validate thousands of generated videos?"

Challenge:
"Manual checking is time-consuming and error-prone.
We need an automated validation system."

SLIDE 3: SOLUTION OVERVIEW
---------------------------
Title: "Our Solution: Video-to-Text Validation"

Approach:
"We implemented a multimodal GenAI system that:
1. Analyzes C3DGAN-generated videos
2. Generates natural language descriptions
3. Extracts key characteristics (view type, demographics)
4. Compares with expected conditions
5. Provides automated validation reports"

Key Concept:
"Using GenAI to validate GenAI - ensuring quality of generated content"

SLIDE 4: METHODOLOGY
---------------------
Title: "How It Works"

Step 1: Video Input
- C3DGAN-generated echocardiogram videos
- Expected conditions (sex, age, view type)

Step 2: Video Analysis
- Extract frames from video
- Analyze video properties (fps, frames, resolution)
- Process metadata

Step 3: Description Generation
- Generate natural language description
- Example: "Echocardiogram video: PSAX view, Female patient, age 6-10 years"

Step 4: Validation
- Compare extracted characteristics with expected
- Verify view type match
- Verify demographic match
- Generate validation report

SLIDE 5: GENAI CONCEPTS USED
-----------------------------
Title: "GenAI Concepts Demonstrated"

1. Video-to-Text Translation
   - Converting visual information to natural language
   - Analyzing video content automatically

2. Multimodal Learning
   - Combining video (visual) + text (descriptions) + metadata (structured)
   - Unified representation of information

3. Conditional Verification
   - Checking if generated content matches input conditions
   - Validating conditional generation correctness

4. Quality Control
   - Using GenAI to validate GenAI outputs
   - Automated quality assurance

SLIDE 6: RESULTS
----------------
Title: "Validation Results"

Quantitative Results:
"✓ 100% accuracy in view type verification
✓ 100% accuracy in patient sex identification

Sample Validation:
"Video 1:
  Expected: PSAX view, Female, age 0-1 years
  Extracted: PSAX view, Female, age 0-1 years
  Status: ✓ MATCH

Video 2:
  Expected: A4C view, Female, age 0-1 years
  Extracted: A4C view, Female, age 0-1 years
  Status: ✓ MATCH"
