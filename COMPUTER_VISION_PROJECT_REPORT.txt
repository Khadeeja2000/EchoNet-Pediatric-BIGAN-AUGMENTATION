================================================================================

PROJECT TITLE:
Temporal Super-Resolution Using Optical Flow for Echocardiogram Video
Enhancement

================================================================================
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

This project implements temporal super-resolution (frame interpolation) for
echocardiogram videos using optical flow. The system increases video frame
rate by interpolating intermediate frames, resulting in smoother motion and
better temporal resolution.

KEY COMPONENTS:
- Dense Optical Flow Computation (Farneback method)
- Frame Interpolation using Forward/Backward Warping
- Temporal Super-Resolution Pipeline
- Motion Visualization

COMPUTER VISION TECHNIQUES USED:
- Optical Flow Estimation
- Dense Motion Field Computation
- Forward and Backward Warping
- Temporal Interpolation
- Motion Vector Visualization

================================================================================
2. WHY THIS PROJECT?
================================================================================

2.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Echocardiogram videos often have limited frame rates (30 fps), which can make
it difficult to capture fine cardiac motion details. Increasing temporal
resolution would:
- Provide smoother motion visualization
- Enable better analysis of cardiac dynamics
- Improve video quality for medical analysis
- Allow better tracking of fast-moving structures

2.2 MOTIVATION:
- Apply classic computer vision techniques to medical imaging
- Demonstrate optical flow for motion analysis
- Improve video temporal resolution without retraining models
- Show practical application of CV concepts

2.3 RESEARCH GAP:
While many projects focus on spatial super-resolution, temporal
super-resolution using optical flow is:
- Less explored in medical video applications
- Provides complementary enhancement to spatial methods
- Uses fundamental CV techniques (optical flow)
- Can be combined with other enhancement methods

================================================================================

================================================================================
4. METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

4.1 OPTICAL FLOW COMPUTATION:
The system uses Farneback's dense optical flow algorithm:
- Multi-scale pyramid approach for robustness
- Polynomial expansion for sub-pixel accuracy
- Computes dense flow field (every pixel)
- Handles large motions through pyramid levels

Algorithm Parameters:
- Pyramid scale: 0.5 (half resolution at each level)
- Pyramid levels: 3
- Window size: 15x15 pixels
- Iterations: 3 per level
- Polynomial neighborhood: 5x5

4.2 FRAME INTERPOLATION:
Two-step process:
1. Forward Warping: Move pixels from frame1 forward using flow
2. Backward Warping: Move pixels from frame2 backward using flow
3. Blending: Combine forward and backward results

Interpolation Formula:
- For alpha ∈ [0, 1]:
  - Forward: pixel moves by alpha * flow
  - Backward: pixel moves by (1-alpha) * backward_flow
  - Result: weighted combination of both

4.3 TEMPORAL SUPER-RESOLUTION PIPELINE:
1. Load video and extract frames
2. For each consecutive frame pair:
   a. Compute optical flow
   b. Interpolate (factor-1) intermediate frames
   c. Insert interpolated frames
3. Write output video with increased frame rate

4.4 VISUALIZATION:
- Optical flow visualized as color-coded images
- Hue: motion direction (0-360°)
